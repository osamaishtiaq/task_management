## Clone and run locally

1. Run `npm i` to install packages
2. Run `npm run supabase:start` to start supabase locally. It will supabase dev local setup and return informatio similar to this:

   ```bash
   API URL: http://localhost:64321
   GraphQL URL: http://localhost:64321/graphql/v1
   DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:64322/postgres
   Studio URL: http://localhost:64323
   Inbucket URL: http://localhost:64324
   JWT secret: super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
   anon key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0
   service_role key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU
   ```

3. Create a .env.local file at root folder with following variables and set values from above step there

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<API URL>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key>
   ```

4. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This%20starter%20configures%20Supabase%20Auth%20to%20use%20cookies%2C%20making%20the%20user's%20session%20available%20throughout%20the%20entire%20Next.js%20app%20-%20Client%20Components%2C%20Server%20Components%2C%20Route%20Handlers%2C%20Server%20Actions%20and%20Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png&integration-ids=oac_VqOgBHqhEoFTPzGkPd7L0iH6)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#how-to-use).
